# NASSCOM-VSD
* Learning the importance of VLSI in today's world.
* Aurdino as example,learnt what is pakaging actually and this package contain small chip.
* Different types of packaging such as QFN(quad flat no-leads), DIP(dual-in line pacakging), TO packaging and other different types

  chip as following parameter:

*PADs are the one's through which signal flows inside and outside of the chip.

*Core is one where the digital logic gates are connected.

*Die is one which determines the size of chip

Introduction to RISC-V architecture: The instructions are the only way through which machine can understand what operations it has to perform. ISA which mean" Instruction Set Architecture" is communicating with machine. Here we write code in c,c++ or java language then through assembler this code will be converted into assembly level language and then to the machine level language as 1or 0. RTL of the design is expressed through hardware description language which will be applied to the layout.

From Software Applications to Hardware
In real life we generally deal with Application Softwares(Apps) in order to communicate with the Hardware.But how it's done exactly? In between Application software and Hardware, there will be a software called System Software. The Applications enter into the System Software and will be converted into the Hardware understandable language i.e Binary Language.

The System Software consists of different layers:

(1) O.S : Other than the general operations like Handling I.O operations, Allocating Memory, Low level System Functions the O.S converts the Application software to respected C,C++,Java etc.. codes.

(2) Compiler : The compiler takes output of O.S as input and converts the codes in C,C++,Java etc.. into Instruction set(.exe files). These instructions will be dependent on type of hardware used.

(3) Assembler : Assembler converts the .exe files into binary language and provides it to the hardware, and hardware performs the respective operations
